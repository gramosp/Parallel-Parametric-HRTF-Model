# Parallel-Parametric-HRTF-Model
This repo contains the PARALLEL PARAMETRIC MODEL of HRTFs (Head Related Transfer Funcions) created with SOS filters

Used in the paper (included) 
J. A. Belloch, G. Ramos, J. M. Badia and M. Cobos, "An Efficient Implementation of Parallel Parametric HRTF Models for Binaural Sound Synthesis in Mobile Multimedia," in IEEE Access, vol. 8, pp. 49562-49573, 2020, doi: 10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2979489.

It contains the MATLAB data set with the delays (ITDs), tilter types, gains, frequencies, Qs of the SOS. It also contains the SOS coefs for direct implementation.
